AI evolves to launch a rocket (ideally). A Unity 6.2 project.

Each individual has a genome containing weights for a neural network.  
The network receives the state of the ship & environment, and outputs controls for thrust, steering, and separating stages.  
An ideal rocket launches into a high, stable orbit.
